## What is it?

It's a web page, plus back-end server, that gathers channel scrible-strip labels and lists them on a web page.

## Who's it for?

For any environment that uses the [Behringer X32](https://www.thomann.de/gb/behringer_digital_mixers.html) family of sound desks, with their [S8/S16](https://www.thomann.de/gb/behringer_s16.htm) digital stagebox products, plus the _Scene_ facility of the desks. When a _scene_ - typically a snapshot of channel assignments etc - is load, all the scribble strip labels are altered on the desk.
The software should also function with the [Midas M32 and M32R](https://www.thomann.de/gb/search_dir.html?sw=midas+m&smcs=77e183_5697) desks (as they share the same core technology).

The web page will follow the configuration of the desk, showing you the newly assigned channel labels.

This becomes really useful when you have band 1 with perhaps "John, Mark, Paul, Flute, Trumpet" assigned to channels 1-5, and band 2 has channels 1-5 labeled "Pete, P/Guit, Lewis, Mary, Sam". Because the web page follows the desk, you can immediately view the latest _who's where_ information.

Here's a photo of the web page in use - running on a rather old iPhone 3GS - located close to our S16.
